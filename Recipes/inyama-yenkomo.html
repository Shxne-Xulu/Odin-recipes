    <h2>Garlic-Butter Rib Roast</h2>    
<p>This impressive, flavor-packed rib roast is perfect for a celebration. The secret? A compound butter made with garlic, anchovies, herbs, and shallot.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 medium garlic heads (about 2 ounces each), cloves peeled</li>
    <li>1 large (2-ounce) shallot, roughly chopped (about 3 tablespoons)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>5 anchovy fillets (from 1 [2-ounce] can), drained </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>2 cups (1 pound) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 (5-pound) boneless rib eye roast, fat cap trimmed to 1/2-inch thick</li>
    <li>4 to 6 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>Flaky sea salt, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>Place garlic cloves in a food processor and process until almost a paste, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Add shallot, rosemary, thyme, chives, anchovies, 1 tablespoon of the salt, and 2 teaspoons of the pepper to food processor. Pulse until shallot is finely chopped, about 5 pulses. Add butter and process until combined, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Transfer half of butter mixture to a sheet of parchment paper; gently roll and shape into a log; refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 3 days. Let remaining butter mixture stand at room temperature up to 4 hours, or transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days; let come to room temperature before continuing.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>Season rib eye roast evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Using a spatula, spread butter mixture in bowl evenly over rib eye roast and transfer roast to a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Add 4 cups of the beef broth to roasting pan. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Preheat oven to 450°F. Roast rib roast in preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Without opening oven door, reduce temperature to 325°F and continue roasting until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of roast registers 130°F, about 1 hour and 40 minutes to 2 hours, occasionally checking liquid level in the bottom of roasting pan and adding remaining 2 cups broth as needed to maintain a depth of at least 1/4 inch. Transfer rib eye roast to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4 :</strong>Meanwhile, pour juices from roasting pan through a fine mesh strainer into a medium saucepan; discard solids. Bring to a simmer over low, skimming and discarding fat as it develops on the surface. Whisk together cornstarch and 3 tablespoons of simmering beef juices in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk cornstarch mixture into juices in saucepan and continue simmering, whisking constantly, until sauce is thickened and coats back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong>Slice rib eye roast against the grain into 1- to 1 1/2-inch-thick slices and arrange on plates. Top each slice evenly with gravy mixture, 1/2-inch-thick rounds of chilled reserved compound butter, thinly sliced chives, flaky sea salt, and 2 or 3 grinds of pepper; serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
<h4>About This Recipe</h4>
<p>Half of the garlicky compound butter in this recipe is slathered all over the roast before it goes into the oven; the other half is rolled up into a log, chilled, and then sliced into medallions to serve with each slice of beef. Special order the rib roast from a local butcher, asking for one with nice marbling and an even fat cap.
